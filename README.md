# Random Quote Generator
First Repo on GitHub.

A simple web application that fetches and displays random quotes using the Quotable API.

# About Me

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Niraj.
For my first project on GitHub, I wanted to create something practical and interactive. That's how I came up with the idea of building a Random Quote Generator. Through this project, I've not only learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but also how to interact with APIs and implement features like local storage caching for a smoother user experience. One of the latest features I've added is the ability to set the background image based on the fetched quote, creating a visual connection between the quote and its backdrop. I'll continue to add new features and improvements to this project as I am still learning and growing.


## Features

- Fetches random quotes from the Quotable API.
- Displays quotes and their authors on the webpage.
- Provides a "Generate Quote" button to fetch new quotes.
- Implements local storage caching for improved performance and offline access.
- Responsive design using media queries for various screen sizes.
- Sets the background image based on the fetched quote to create a visual connection.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-quote-generator.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd random-quote-generator
   
3. Open the index.html file in your web browser to use the application
