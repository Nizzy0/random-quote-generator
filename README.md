# Random Quote Generator
First Repo on GitHub.

A simple web application that fetches and displays random quotes using the Quotable API.

# About Me

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Niraj, and this is my very first project on GitHub. Excited to share my Web Dev journey with this simple yet fun project.

For my first project on GitHub, I wanted to create something practical and interactive. That's how I came up with the idea of building a Random Quote Generator. Through this project, I've not only learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but also how to interact with APIs and implement features like local storage caching for a smoother user experience. Will continue to add new stuff to this project, as I am still learning.

## Features

- Fetches random quotes from the Quotable API.
- Displays quotes and their authors on the webpage.
- Provides a "Generate Quote" button to fetch new quotes.
- Implements local storage caching for improved performance and offline access.
- Responsive design using media queries for various screen sizes.
- More to Come!

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-quote-generator.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd random-quote-generator
   
3. Open the index.html file in your web browser to use the application
